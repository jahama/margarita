# TextField with a suffix

## Description

Input field with a suffix.
The suffix property accepts both text and symbols.

## How to use it? (Controls)

We can edit the same items from the text-field + the **suffix**.

- Aria label
- Edit label
- Edit placeholder value
- Add and edit suffix
- Error message
- State

If the user misses that the input already has a suffix and enters it → Allow this in our validation and do not show an error.

⚠️  **How not to use it**

- Do not rely only on suffixes, some users will not read them.
- Suffix property does not replace the label's responsibilities. If you need a specific type of data, emphasize it in the input's label or placeholder.

## When to use it

- When there is a commonly understood symbol or abbreviation for the type of information we are asking for.
- When the user needs to enter a value which has a specific unit.

***For example:***

The user wants to put solar panels on their rooftop and the total cost is 8.000€. They need to specify how much they want to pay at the moment (the rest will be financed).

👉 The user needs to enter an amount and whatever the amount → it will be € → so we fill the unit for them.
