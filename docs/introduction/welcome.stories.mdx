# The official way to build web experiences in Holaluz

Margarita is the web implementation of the Holaluz's Design System. Our primary goal is to create a system that can be used to build consistent, accessible, and performant web user experiences for our users, delivering value as fast as we can.

DISCLAIMER: While Margarita is open source, its purpose is to improve code quality, consistency, and cross-team collaboration at Holaluz. Thus, it’s likely that we will introduce breaking API changes more often than usual.
